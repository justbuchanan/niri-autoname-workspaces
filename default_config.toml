# Default icon mappings
# You can define your own icons by creating a file of the same format at
# ~/.config/niri/autoname-workspaces.toml

# Default icon for applications not in the list below
default = "*"

# Format for the currently focused window icon
# Use {} as a placeholder for where the icon should go.
# If you're using waybar, you can use pango markup as below. If you're using a
# different bar, you'll need to see what markup syntax it supports, if any.
focused_format = "<big>{}</big>"
# note that you can also color the focused icon with:
# focused_format = "<span foreground='#0096FF'><big>{}</big></span>"
